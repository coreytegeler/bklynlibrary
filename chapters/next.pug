			strong Focus Areas

		p As the Library continues to build upon and refine our foundational principles, we will take steps to become ever more adaptive to technological change and more responsive to community needs. Now more than ever, a cookie-cutter or franchise approach to library services will not be effective. Our neighborhoods are too diverse and our programs and resources too wide-ranging for services to be delivered the same way in every location. 

		p Moving beyond a more traditional service model requires prioritizing relationships and partnerships, not just transactions. It requires that we do more to uncover needs and opportunities in our neighborhoods and mobilize resources to respond with the right services. In this regard, our branch libraries will need to draw on individual staff judgement and initiative, creativity and entrepreneurialism, as well as a shared understanding of core values and methods.

		p The following focus areas are meant to help us realize this vision. Though each encompasses a distinct set of initiatives, they overlap heavily and their ultimate purpose is the same: to create and deliver public library services that are high-quality and community-centered, consistent and responsive.

		p The first focus area, Establishing Priorities, outlines steps for designing services through clearly established internal models and outside partner- ships. The second, Focusing on Community, identifies tools and practices to tailor programs to individual neighborhoods. And the third, Innovating through Collaboration and Learning, unveils a set of initiatives to enable experimentation and staff development. 

		p These focus areas and the goals and initiatives they encompass were inspired by ideas that surfaced in our charrettes and focus groups. To ensure their successful implementation, the Library will continue to tap staff expertise in all departments and locations.

						p One reason for being explicit about core principles in this plan, and for going into so much detail about our established approaches and methods, was to give our staff and service partners an opportunity to reflect on our work. This is a process that we will continue over the next few years during the plan’s implementation, and it will require us to adjust our approaches and occasionally scale back or even eliminate services when they aren’t in alignment with these principles, or prove ineffective. 

						p In order to accommodate a growing number of services and programs, the Library must also find ways to increase internal capacity while maintaining or even improving service excellence. To do this, BPL will identify and test models for new services and streamline partnerships with outside organizations and stakeholders. 

						p Drawing on clearly defined models when introducing new and specialized services can help us better coordinate efforts and ensure the highest potential impact. Whether in the form of toolkits, playbooks, or programs in a box, models can encompass a wide variety of different programs and services, including everything from literacy classes and digital media workshops to open houses and retail marketing practices. They should be prototyped and documented, and packaged with instructions and any necessary materials for replication.

						blockquote.left Inviting staff Into the process of creating new programs empowers  them to make Modifications and improvements of their own.

						p One of the purposes of the Library’s BKLYN Incubator program, which awards innovation grants to staff members and their community partners, is to identify and test innovative new services that can be adopted in other neighborhoods. One incubator program that has already been piloted and replicated by other staff members is Cypress Hill’s Career Exploration Academy. This program consists of three librarian-led workshops that introduce participants to resources at the Library and three guest lectures by a variety of local professionals. When implementing the program, librarians receive a detailed curriculum and information on how to recruit guest speakers. 

						p Other successful incubator programs that have, or will be, adopted at new locations include a small business program for childcare providers which recently won a prestigious Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant, a podcasting program, and a teen journalism program. Each of these has a clear set of parameters and instructions for customization and replication, and some include specialized equipment and materials. 

						p The Youth and Family Services Department has taken a similar approach in dramatically expanding STEM programs for school-aged children. In partnership with the New York Hall of Science, the team developed a set of hands-on learning activities that can be easily administered in a library setting, sourced the necessary materials, and developed instructions and training sessions for the librarians who manage them. Library Lab STEM programs are now a major part of BPL’s educational repertoire. 

						p This process of testing and replicating models not only makes it easier to incorporate new services, it enables staff members from across the organization to contribute innovations. By inviting staff into the process of creating new programs and making our source material easy to use and adapt, we empower them to make modifications and improvements of their own. 

						p Another important way to create organizational capacity while maintaining a high level of excellence is through partnerships with outside organizations. In Fiscal Year 2017, BPL hosted a record 70,000 program sessions for more than 997,000 attendees. Many of these were designed and managed internally but a large number involved outside partners, including citywide institutions or agencies and local community-based organizations. 

						p As the Library increases collaborative efforts with external stakeholders at the branch level, it will take steps to clarify and streamline the process of creating and managing partnerships. In addition to facilitating agreements, this will involve collecting and sharing information about high quality organizations and the outcomes of particular partner-supported services. It will also involve clarifying rules around community room use and updating community room designs to better accommodate the Library’s growing range of educational and cultural programs.

									.nn-indent Making Space
									p To better accommodate educational and cultural programs, BPL is developing a new vision for the community room. The Library is creating a kit of parts—including customized storage cabinets, mobile media stations, signage, and lighting—that can be deployed in different ways to create classrooms, maker labs, performance spaces and more.

								li
									.nn-indent Programs in a Box
									p BPL is developing a series of programs that come with prepackaged activities, supplies, and hands-on training to make replication and customization easy for public service staff. These “Programs in a Box” include a new astronomy program for children and a podcasting program for young adults, among others. 

								li
									.nn-indent Creative Book Displays
									p BPL is creating a set of tools and guidelines for showcasing books and other materials in an attractive, timely and consistent manner. These displays will reflect community interests and both system wide and branch specific programming themes.

					h1 II. Focusing on Community
				.nn-inside
					.nn-hidden-content
						p In a borough as diverse as Brooklyn, different communities often require different things from their local library. Demographics and neighborhood amenities can vary dramatically from place to place. Some neighborhoods have a large population of aging residents and few resources aside from the library to keep their minds active. Others have a large number of immigrants with low levels of English language ability and not enough support services or English classes. In some neighborhoods teen programs are in high demand, while in others services for young families are the highest priority. 

						p To become more responsive to the different needs of our neighborhoods, BPL will prioritize two things: data and community engagement. 

						p Over the last year, BPL has been developing a series of data dashboards with key user metrics and demographic data for each branch and its community. Though user data is aggregated to protect the privacy of our patrons, staff members at all levels of the organization have access to current and historical data on what drives the activity in every branch, and can compare branches with similar usage patterns. In some locations, checkouts predominate, while in others patrons primarily use the internet or take part in public programs. 

						blockquote.left In a borough as diverse as Brooklyn, different communities often require different things from their local library.

						p Demographic information is tied to each branch’s specific service area, and includes up-to-date Census data on age, educational attainment, English proficiency, languages spoken at home, and more. Branch staff can use this information to prioritize resources or plan new services, while drawing upon personal knowledge of patron needs and community issues. For example: branches with high circulation levels might prioritize customer service and programs that build on the collection; branches with relatively low circulation numbers might focus on educational and community-building programs; and branches with both low circulation numbers and visits might emphasize outreach and community partnerships. 

						p BPL will balance the use of data with input from residents, community leaders, and organizational partners. 

						p At present, branch staff regularly attend community board meetings and select tenant association meetings at New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) campuses, and build and manage a wide range of community partnerships, including 30 Friends Groups at neighborhood libraries across the borough. Over the next several years, the Library will continue to encourage staff to take community leadership roles, participate in important neighborhood meetings and events, and initiate open houses and facilitated discussions with residents. The Library will also prioritize outreach to neighborhood schools and community-based organizations, and, as mentioned, will clarify guidelines and expectations regarding partnerships. 

						p Lastly, BPL will prioritize community engagement for all major capital projects over the next several years. During the design and development of new facilities in Brooklyn Heights, Greenpoint, and Sunset Park, the Library held facilitated discussions with a wide variety of neighborhood stakeholders. For the design of the soon to be built Sunset Park Library, for instance, BPL hosted two large-scale charrettes with residents and three meetings with smaller groups of stakeholders, and conducted in-person surveys throughout the neighborhood. Discussions were held in English, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese, and organizers made a concerted effort to facilitate discussions among immigrants, older adults, school children, and more.6 

						p Though resources may be more limited in future projects, the Library will use the Sunset Park engagement process as a model for the future, one that sets the stage for meaningful discussions about the new or renovated facility and the Library’s broader role in the neighborhood.

									.nn-indent Data for Decision Making
									p BPL is developing a series of user-friendly data dashboards that allow staff members from across the organization to access and manipulate large data sets, including those encompassing neighborhood demographic and branch performance information. Staff members are trained to use and interpret the data when prioritizing resources or introducing new services or programs.

								li
									.nn-indent Mobile Serve
									p BPL is developing a mobile reference device that will allow front-line staff to create library cards and provide reference support from anywhere inside or outside the branches. Mobile Serve supports proactive, community-centered librarianship by freeing staff from their desks and even their buildings, and enabling them to bring key library services to schools, community-based organizations, fairs, and elsewhere.

								li
									.nn-indent Community Engagement and Outreach
									p Through the BKLYN Incubator, Outreach Services, and Government and Community Affairs, BPL is creating a series of toolkits and model programs for community engagement events and community partner “meet and greets.” The Library is also working with key staff members at every branch to expand leadership roles in their neighborhoods, including roles in key community-wide meetings, such as community board meetings and Tenant Association meetings at select NYCHA campuses.

					h1 III. Innovating through Collaboration and Learning
				.nn-inside
					.nn-hidden-content
						p During the strategic planning process, the lack of communication and collaboration across different Library locations and departments was raised as a big concern among participants. Our staff are eager to learn more about what their peers are doing, what initiatives are taking place in other communities, and what expectations or guidelines to consider when implementing a new program or moving to a new location.

						p To improve on these fronts and better support a culture of collaboration and innovation, BPL will prioritize three interrelated initiatives: a system of branch networks focused on distinct areas of service, a set of improved internal communication processes and tools, and expanded resources for professional development.

						p Through a new system of branch networks we can elevate challenges that may not be widely known or understood and test or prototype solutions before adopting them system wide.  

						p Over the next year, BPL will introduce five distinct networks of branches, each dedicated to a particular set of issues, including immigration services, young adult services, older adult services, collection management, and community outreach. Branches, including Central Library, will draw on demographic and performance data as well as staff knowledge of their communities to choose their own network affiliation.

						p While supplementing the geographic service model currently in place, these networks will be charged with developing and piloting new services. Members will meet regularly to prioritize and pursue new ideas. Once the networks have identified challenges and proposed specific next steps, representatives from relevant administrative departments will help members resolve issues and establish protocols.

						p Though every branch is required to join one of the five networks, the affiliations are fluid. Branches will have an opportunity to change networks and propose new ones. Frontline staff will have an opportunity to learn about the issues and progress relevant to each network through reports and system wide meetings.

						blockquote.left Through a system of branch networks BPL will do more to support collaborations among staff.

						p To support these efforts, BPL will prioritize internal communications, including clear messaging to staff about internal policies and procedures, guidelines for programs and services, and information sharing about key initiatives, projects, and events. The Library will look to revamp its intranet, while introducing new practices and digital tools to support collaborations across the system. The Library will also do more to find and share models of excellence. In this strategic plan, we are setting an example with the spotlight stories on pages 44–51, which feature staff members who have developed successful and replicable approaches to key library services, including outreach at homeless shelters, creative partnerships with community stakeholders, and safe havens in culturally diverse neighborhoods. Going forward, BPL will continue to highlight models of excellence in a staff newsletter and on its website and social media channels. 

						p Finally, BPL will take steps to increase and better organize professional development opportunities for staff. Today employees take advantage of training sessions in a wide variety of areas, from workplace issues to government regulations to literacy and digital privacy. Specialized trainings are offered for branch supervisors, custodians, public safety officers, technology resource specialists, children’s librarians, and more. But the Library will do more to create individualized development plans and incorporate new learning and development approaches; and it will increase the number of offerings in several priority areas, including community outreach and engagement.

									.nn-indent Branch Networks
									p BPL will be introducing five distinct branch networks, each encompassing a particular set of topics, including immigration services, young adult services, older adult services, collection management, and community outreach. These networks are meant to facilitate collaboration and information sharing across different locations and departments, while helping the Library better tailor services to particular community characteristics and needs.

								li
									.nn-indent Internal Communications
									p BPL is revitalizing its approach to internal communications with the dual goal of keeping staff members informed and inspired. An internal communications committee will be charged with revamping the broad spectrum of existing employee communications—from digital and print announcements to employee orientation and benefits materials—as well as introducing technology to encourage collaboration among staff members, including a redesigned intranet and online sharing tools.

								li
									.nn-indent BKLYN Incubator
									p In addition to providing a safe space for experimentation and testing, BKLYN Incubator is a project-based learning program that offers a variety of interactive workshops. Among other things, participants learn to uncover opportunities for new services in their communities, write compelling proposals, create and deliver dynamic presentations, and use iterative design processes to test new ideas.

			strong How We Got Here
		ul
			li
				p What approaches are most effective when it comes to community outreach?
			li
				p What tools and practices can we adapt from other community-based organizations?
			li
				p How can the Library make small local efforts reverberate throughout the system and the borough?


		p These were just some of the questions raised during our strategic planning process, which started in the summer of 2016 and ended in early 2017. To kick off the process a team from the design firm IDEO led us through three days of charrettes, during which teams of staff members and trustees discussed a wide range of issues. 

		p The teams identified core values of the library and worked together to flesh out over 40 ideas for new services and internal processes, including new teen training programs, dinner-and-dialog stakeholder events, a community partner catalog, and more. One team developed a messaging campaign called Ask Me Anything that promoted questioning and critical thinking. Another devised a series of events called Challenge Shares that would give staff an opportunity to advise and learn from one another. Yet another designed a method for sharing, testing, and improving new services and programs by taking them from branch to branch and carefully documenting the outcomes.

		.nn-image
			img(src='/assets/imgs/image10.jpg')
			.nn-image-caption Over 300 librarians, clerks, administrators, and trustees participated in visioning sessions and focus groups

		p The results of these charrettes were turned into an idea gallery, with illustrated posters organized into themes such as staff connections, community outreach, and telling our story. Throughout the summer, the posters were displayed at staff receptions held at five different branches across the system. Attendees were directed to leave stickers next to the ideas they liked most as well as Post-it notes with additional questions or concerns. By the end, over 300 staff members from across the organization had participated, including over 60 who took part in the full day charrettes.

		p Throughout this process staff members were consistently drawn to ideas that amplified our communities and patrons, and connected us more meaningfully to partners and stakeholders. There was an overwhelming desire for more collaboration and learning across the system, and for trying new things and documenting their outcomes. Among the concerns were a perceived lack of focus on collection management and internal operations, two topics we hope to address more fully during the plan’s implementation. 

		p In the fall and winter of 2016/17, we held retreats with the Library’s leadership team and board of trustees to discuss many of the issues and ideas raised during our staff engagement sessions. They helped us select and refine many key ideas as well as the overall vision of a community-centered BPL. But we hope it is obvious to all those who took part in our charrettes and idea galleries that the resulting plan owes its existence to their ideas and insights. 
		
		p As we begin the process of implementation, we will continue to leverage staff expertise to improve the services of the Library and deepen its impact on patrons and communities across the borough. As we move closer toward our goal of becoming a community-centered library, we look forward to engaging our patrons and partners and incorporating what we hear in our services.
