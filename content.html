</div><p><strong>Core Principles</strong></p><p>At BPL, we believe there are many ways to learn, that welcoming people from all beliefs and backgrounds is crucial for democracy, and that listening and taking an interest are fundamental characteristics of strong communities. We protect our patrons’ personal privacy, including their digital privacy, because we believe in intellectual freedom and take seriously our role in supporting learners and information seekers of all kinds. We take pride in sparking people’s curiosity and believe learning is most e ective when it’s fun.</p><blockquote class="left">THE PURSUIT OF KNOWING WAS FREEDOM TO ME, THE RIGHT TO DECLARE YOUR OWN CURIOSITIES AND FOLLOW THEM</blockquote><p>This section of the plan expresses our values in  ve core principles and examines how we put them into action. In making these principles explicit, we provide our patrons with a clearer sense of what makes us who we are, and give our sta  and service partners a better idea of how we might improve in the future. Over the last decade, one of BPL’s strengths has been its ability to meet and improve existing services and programs, and dream up and execute new ones, we will ensure they spring from the following core principles.</p><p>Shortly after its establishment in 1896, Brooklyn Public Library published its  rst annual report, declaring its undertaking “to improve the quality of the minds of the people... and lay the foundation of a better civilization for the future,” which still seems apt 120 years later. BPL has remained committed to this founding mission, though how we execute that mission has remarkably evolved.</p><p><strong>Our Five Core Principals:</strong></p><div class="inline_nav accordion"><div class="content_wrapper"><a href="#"><h1>I.TO FOSTER LITERACY AND THE LOVE OF LEARNING</h1></a><div class="inside"><div class="hidden_content"><p>One important insight behind the founding of this and other public libraries across the country is the idea that reading is transformational, that through reading we can not only learn new things but discover new worlds. In his award-winning essay collection, “Between the World and Me,” Ta-Nehisi Coates writes about this aspect of the library and what it meant to his own intellectual development. “The pursuit of knowing was freedom to me,” he writes, “the right to declare your own curiosities and follow them through all manner of books. I was made for the library, not the classroom.”</p><p>Like Coates, many patrons rely on BPL as an alternative to school, a place where they are surrounded by books and other resources, and can follow their intuitions and interests at their own pace.
