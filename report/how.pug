				p What approaches are most effective when it comes to community outreach?
			li
				p What tools and practices can we adapt from other community-based organizations?
			li
				p How can the Library make small local efforts reverberate throughout the system and the borough?


		p These were just some of the questions raised during our strategic planning process, which started in the summer of 2016 and ended in early 2017. To kick off the process a team from the design firm IDEO led us through three days of charrettes, during which teams of staff members and trustees discussed a wide range of issues. 

		p The teams identified core values of the library and worked together to flesh out over 40 ideas for new services and internal processes, including new teen training programs, dinner-and-dialog stakeholder events, a community partner catalog, and more. One team developed a messaging campaign called Ask Me Anything that promoted questioning and critical thinking. Another devised a series of events called Challenge Shares that would give staff an opportunity to advise and learn from one another. Yet another designed a method for sharing, testing, and improving new services and programs by taking them from branch to branch and carefully documenting the outcomes.

		p The results of these charrettes were turned into an idea gallery, with illustrated posters organized into themes such as staff connections, community outreach, and telling our story. Throughout the summer, the posters were displayed at staff receptions held at five different branches across the system. Attendees were directed to leave stickers next to the ideas they liked most as well as Post-it notes with additional questions or concerns. By the end, over 300 staff members from across the organization had participated, including over 60 who took part in the full day charrettes.

		p Throughout this process staff members were consistently drawn to ideas that amplified our communities and patrons, and connected us more meaningfully to partners and stakeholders. There was an overwhelming desire for more collaboration and learning across the system, and for trying new things and documenting their outcomes. Among the concerns were a perceived lack of focus on collection management and internal operations, two topics we hope to address more fully during the plan’s implementation. 

		p In the fall and winter of 2016/17, we held retreats with the Library’s leadership team and board of trustees to discuss many of the issues and ideas raised during our staff engagement sessions. They helped us select and refine many key ideas as well as the overall vision of a community-centered BPL. But we hope it is obvious to all those who took part in our charrettes and idea galleries that the resulting plan owes its existence to their ideas and insights. 
		
		p As we begin the process of implementation, we will continue to leverage staff expertise to improve the services of the Library and deepen its impact on patrons and communities across the borough. As we move closer toward our goal of becoming a community-centered library, we look forward to engaging our patrons and partners and incorporating what we hear in our services.
